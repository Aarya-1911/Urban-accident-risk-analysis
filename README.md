**Urban Accident Risk Intelligence System**:
A data‑driven project analyzing state‑wise road accident patterns in India using Python, machine learning, and clustering. The goal is to identify high‑risk regions and understand key factors contributing to accident severity.

**What this project does:**
- Cleans and preprocesses accident data
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Computes accident severity metrics
- Applies K‑Means clustering to group states by risk
- Visualizes trends and patterns

 **Project Structure:**
  
data/          → raw & cleaned datasets

notebooks/     → Jupyter notebooks (EDA, modeling, clustering)

scripts/       → reusable Python modules

models/        → saved ML models (KMeans, scaler)

**Tech Used:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit‑learn

**Future Enhancements**:
- Add geospatial maps
- Build a Streamlit dashboard
- Deploy clustering model as an API
